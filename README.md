InsightArena is a next-generation decentralized prediction market platform built natively on the **[Stellar network](https://stellar.org/)**.
 By leveraging Stellar's high-throughput consensus protocol and the robust **Soroban** smart contract environment, InsightArena provides users with a lightning-fast, highly secure, and incredibly cost-effective way to participate in global prediction events and competitive leaderboard challenges.

Users can submit predictions on real-world outcomes such as sports results, crypto prices, or other measurable events. Thanks to Stellar's nearly instant transaction finality and fraction-of-a-cent fees, participants can interact with markets seamlessly without the friction found on other blockchains. All predictions, outcomes, and payouts are automatically resolved and recorded transparently through secure Soroban smart contracts.

In addition to regular global markets, **any user can easily create their own custom prediction events and leaderboards**. Creators can open these events to the public or make them private competitions, generating special invite codes that friends can use to join in. Whether public or private, participants earn points based on performance and compete for top rewards.

By fusing traditional prediction markets with gamified competition, and powering it all with Stellar's enterprise-grade infrastructure, InsightArena creates an engaging, transparent, and trust-minimized ecosystem where users can test their insights, host private challenges, compete globally, and earn rewards based on their accuracy.

## InsightArena AI Agent

InsightArena is also an **AI-native platform** built on the **[Stellar network](https://stellar.org/)**. An autonomous AI Agent runs 24/7 as a **Prediction Analyst** (generating AI picks and competing on the leaderboard), **Market Creator** (auto-populating daily fixtures from the sports oracle), **Oracle Validator** (cross-checking results from two sources before settling on-chain via Soroban), **Leaderboard Coach** (delivering personalised insights to every user), and a **Creator Assistant** — helping anyone who builds a custom event pick the best matches, set deadlines, and structure competitions for maximum engagement.

- PostgreSQL 14+ → https://postgresql.org
- Make

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arena1X/InsightArena.git
cd InsightArena
```

### 2. Backend (NestJS API)

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, SERVER_SECRET_KEY
pnpm install
pnpm migration:run
pnpm start:dev
# → http://localhost:3000/api/v1
# → http://localhost:3000/api/v1/docs (Swagger UI)
```

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env.local
# Set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
pnpm install
pnpm dev
# → http://localhost:3001
```

### 4. Contract (Soroban/Rust) — optional

```bash
cd contract
make build   # compile to WASM
make test    # run unit tests
```

## Core Features

- **AI Agent competes on the leaderboard** — the platform's own AI enters every market as a ranked user, giving every participant a live benchmark to beat
- **Two-source oracle validation** — match results are cross-checked across two independent sports APIs before being written to Soroban smart contracts, eliminating single-point-of-failure corruptions
- **Self-populating markets** — an autonomous fixture sync pulls live schedules every hour and creates prediction markets with zero admin input, so the platform never goes stale
- **Personalised Leaderboard Coach** — the AI analyses each user's prediction history and delivers tailored weekly insights to help them improve and stay engaged
- **Private competitions with invite codes** — any user can host their own closed leaderboard and share a unique invite link with friends or communities
- **AI-assisted market creation** — when creators build their own custom events, the AI recommends the best match selections, optimal deadlines, and competition structures to maximise engagement
- **Trustless settlement on Stellar** — all escrow, payouts, and outcome resolution run through auditable Soroban smart contracts with sub-second finality and near-zero fees
